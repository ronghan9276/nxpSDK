Overview
========
The flexio_i2c_interrupt example shows how to use flexio i2c master driver in interrupt way:

In this example, a flexio simulated i2c master connect to an I2C slave.
Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-KL81Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example is requires connecting the FLEXIO pins with the I2C pins
The connection should be set as following:
- J12-3, J4-10 connected
- J12-4, J4-12 connected

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
