Overview
========
The FTM project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK FTM driver to use FTM as a timer.
It sets up the FTM hardware block to trigger an interrupt every 1 millisecond.
When the FTM interrupt is triggered a message a printed on the UART terminal.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.1
- Keil MDK  5.30
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- HVP-KE18F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No need special setting

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
These instructions are displayed/shown on the terminal window:
