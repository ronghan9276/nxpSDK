Overview
========
The dspi_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use DSPI driver in interrupt way:

In this example , one dspi instance used as DSPI master and another dspi instance used as DSPI slave in the same board.
This example uses the transactional API in DSPI driver.

1. DSPI master send/received data to/from DSPI slave in interrupt . (DSPI Slave using interrupt to receive/send the data)


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-K66F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
SPI one board:
Transfer data from instance0 to instance 1 of SPI interface.
SPI0 pins are connected with SPI1 pins of board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
INSTANCE0(SPI0)     CONNECTS TO         INSTANCE1(SPI1)
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name  Board Location
MISO       J2 pin 10           MISO      J6 pin 6
MOSI       J2 pin 8            MOSI      J6 pin 7
SCK        J2 pin 12           SCK       J6 pin 5
PCS0       J2 pin 6            PCS0      J6 pin 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

DSPI interrupt example start.
This example use one dspi instance as master and another as slave on one board.
Master and slave are both use interrupt way.
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:
DSPI_master -- DSPI_slave
   CLK      --    CLK
   PCS      --    PCS
   SOUT     --    SIN
   SIN      --    SOUT
This is DSPI slave call back .

DSPI transfer all data matched!
