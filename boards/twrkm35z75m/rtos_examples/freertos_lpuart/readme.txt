Overview
========
This example is showing data send and receive via FreeRTOS adapted LPUART driver. Program initially send
string into serial terminal via virtual COM. After that, user may send some custom input and
application will return every 4 characters back to console. If delay from last user input exceed
10s (receive timeout) notification about exceeded timeout appear and application will finish.
Example need only single LPUART instance.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.6.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- TWR-KM35Z75M board
- Personal Computer
- USB to Com Converter

Board settings
==============
Connect pin:
- RX of USB2COM to J14-1
- TX of USB2COM to J16-1
- GND of USB2COM to J22-3

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect USB to Com Converter between the PC host and the port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
You will see the welcome string printed out on the console.
You can send characters to the console back and they will be printed out onto console in a group of 4 characters.
