Overview
========
The flexio_uart_interrupt example shows how to use flexio uart driver in interrupt way:

In this example, a flexio simulated uart connect to PC through USB-Serial, the board will send back all characters
that PC send to the board. Note: two queued transfer in this example, so please input even number characters.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.6.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- FRDM-KE17Z board
- USB to Com converter
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example requires connecting the FLEXIO pins with the USB2COM pins
The connection should be set as following:
    - PTA11, FLEXIO_UART_RX_PIN, J2-17
    - PTA10, FLEXIO_UART_TX_PIN, J2-15
    -        GND               , J2-14

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Board receives 8 characters then sends them out
Now please input:
