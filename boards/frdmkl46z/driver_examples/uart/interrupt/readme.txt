Overview
========
The uart_functioncal_interrupt example shows how to use uart driver functional
API to receive data with interrupt method:

In this example, one uart instance connect to PC through uart, the board will
send back all characters that PC send to the board.

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-KL46Z board
- Personal Computer
- USB to Com Converter

Board settings
==============
Connect pin:
- RX of USB2COM to J2-18
- TX of USB2COM to J2-20
- GND of USB2COM to J2-14

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:
