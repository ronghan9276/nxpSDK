Overview
========
The lpuart_interrupt_transfer_seven_bits Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK lpuart driver with seven data bits feature enabled.
In the example, you can send characters to the console back and they will be printed out onto console
 in a group of 8 characters.
NOTE: Please set com port format to "7 data bits without parity bit" in PC's com port tool

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.6.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVKB-IMXRT1050 board
- Personal Computer
- USB to Com Converter

Board settings
==============
Connect pin:
- RX of USB2COM to J22-2
- TX of USB2COM to J22-1
- GND of USB2COM to J24-7

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 7 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal(from USB To Serial Adapter):
