Overview
========
The i2c_interrupt_b2b_transfer_slave example shows how to use i2c driver as slave to do board to board transfer 
with interrupt:

In this example, one i2c instance as slave and another i2c instance on the other board as master. Master sends a 
piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from 
slave is correct.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- TWR-KV11Z75M board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Connect Jump J4 2-3
Connect Jump J11 2-3

I2C one board:
  + Transfer data from MASTER_BOARD to SLAVE_BOARD of I2C interface, I2C0 pins of MASTER_BOARD are connected with
    I2C0 pins of SLAVE_BOARD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MASTER_BOARD        CONNECTS TO         SLAVE_BOARD
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name   Board Location
I2C0_SCL       J24-19          I2C0_SCL       J24-19
I2C0_SDA       J24-20          I2C0_SDA       J24-20
GND            J24-1           GND            J24-1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
