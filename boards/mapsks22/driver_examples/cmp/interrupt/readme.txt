Overview
========

The CMP interrupt Example shows how to use interrupt with CMP driver.

In this example, user should indicate an input channel to capture a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the 
CMP's positive channel input. On the negative side, the internal 6-bit DAC is used to generate the fixed voltage about
half value of reference voltage.

When running the project, change the input voltage of user-defined channel, then the comparator's output would change
between logic one and zero when the user-defined channel's voltage crosses the internal DAC's value. The change of
comparator's output would generate the falling and rising edge events with their interrupts enabled. When any CMP 
interrupt happens, the CMP's ISR would turn on the LED light if detecting the output's rising edge, or turn off it when
detecting the output's falling edge.

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MAPS-KS22F256 board & MAPS-DOCK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The cmp_interrupt_example is configured to use UART1 with PTE0 and PTE1 pins. To make JLink serial
device work, the jumpers on MAPS-DOCK board should be set as following:
- JP7 on MAPS-Dock: UART0 related jumpers connected

To observe the example result, please connect on & off Pin-78 to GND pad in turn on MAPS-KS22F256 board.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the USB port (CN14) on MAPS-DOCK board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

Then change CMP analog input, and watch the change of LED.
    - CMP0_IN0 (Jump CN9D-78) connected to VCC=3.3V(Jump CN9D-89): LED RED on
    - CMP0_IN0 (Jump CN9D-78) connected to GND (Jump CN9D-88): LED RED off
