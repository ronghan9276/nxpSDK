Overview
========

The lwip_udpecho demo application demonstrates a UDP echo demo on the lwIP TCP/IP stack with bare metal KSDK or
FreeRTOS, which uses the UDP protocol and acts as an echo server. The application sends back the received UDP packets
from the PC, which can be used to test whether a UDP connection is available.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.10.2
- Keil MDK  5.34
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.5.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- Network cable RJ45 standard
- EVK-MIMXRT1020 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.


Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
2. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J23.
3. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA(or USB to Serial) USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial(or USB to Serial) device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Insert the Ethernet Cable into the target board's RJ45 port and connect it to your PC network adapter.
4.  Configure the host PC IP address to 192.168.0.100.
5.  Download the program to the target board.
7.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
1. When the demo runs, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

2. From the command window, type echotool 192.168.0.102 /p udp /r 7 /d hello
	NOTE: The echotool.exe application can be found here https://github.com/PavelBansky/EchoTool
3. The command window should get response:
